    Timo Jyrinki:
      - Update debian/watch.
      - Update debian/copyright.
    Felix Geyer:
      - Compress binary packages with xz.
      - Build qtcreator out-of-source.
      - Link Qt Creator against the system botan library instead of using
        the bundled one.

      - Don't call dh_makeshlibs as qtcreator doesn't provide any public shared

  [ Fathi Boudra ]
  * Bump Standard-Version to 3.8.2. No changes needed.
  * Update debian/rules:
    - Remove translations build. Infrastructure for translations added
      upstream.
    - Improve clean target by removing extra directories.
    - Remove dh_desktop call. Deprecated.

      qt4-docs and qt4-demos being installed.
  * Update debian/qtcreator.install.
  * Fix wrapper target path moved to bin/bin.pro.
  * Fix static and translations target installation.

  [ Adam Majer ]

    version of Qt. Qt Creator automates this process and will compile
    and install the debugging helper in the user's local directory.
    The compilation routine is in the Tools -> Options -> Qt 4 -> Version
    window.
  * Install the LGPL_EXCEPTION.TXT in addition to mentioning it in copyright
    as gdbmacros source code that is copied to user's local directory
    requires a license.
